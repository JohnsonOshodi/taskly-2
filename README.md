Good day,

Here is a brief of this Taskly project, it a final year school project to test my understanding of building projects and the details below is what is expected of the project outcome:

 Taskly

Taskly is a robust task management system designed to streamline project management and team collaboration. Featuring real-time updates, automated reminders, and comprehensive reporting, Taskly ensures seamless task tracking and efficient workflow management, empowering teams to stay organized and productive.

Requirements and Implementation Guide
- Authentication and Authorization: All users are required to create an account and they must belong to an organization. Organizations can be created initially by a user(owner) 
- Boards and Tasks: every organization should be able to have boards where they track their various tasks. The task can be assigned to users within the organization, it should have priorities, labels, status, start date, due date, comments, description and ability to store images/videos as attachments. Tasks on boards should be filterable by status, task owners, priorities, labels.
- Collaboration: owners and users should be able to invite others to join their boards
- Notifications: Taskly should notify users when they are assigned to a task, when the due date is 1 day, 12 hours and 1 hour past due. Notify users on a task when comments are created on the task. Add more use cases where possible.
- Analytics: depending on the statuses that are set, owners should get a weekly report of the amount of tasks that were completed, still pending etc. It should also give report on the average time to complete tasks
Best Practices:
You are required to build with either Nodejs(TypeScript) or Python.
Don't always hit the DB, use a cache layer.
Ensure you write unit and integration tests where possible
Implement rate limiting
It would be better if you could spec and document the API with OpenAPI using something like https://stoplight.io/
